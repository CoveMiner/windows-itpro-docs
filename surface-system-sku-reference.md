# System SKU Reference
This document provides a reference of System Model and System SKU names that you can use to quickly determine the machine state of a specific device using PowerShell, WMI, 

System Model and System SKU are variables stored in System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) tables in the UEFI layer of Surface devices.  The System SKU name is required to differentiate between devices with the same System Model name, such as Surface Pro and Surface Pro with LTE Advanced. 

| **Device**                                                   | System Model** | **System SKU**                   |

## Examples 

**PowerShell**
 Use the following PowerShell command to pull System SKU: 

     gwmi -namespace root\wmi -class MS_SystemInformation | select SystemSKU 

**System Information**
You can also find the System SKU and System Model for a device in System Information. 
Click **Start** >  **MSInfo32**.  

One example of how you could use this in Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or System Center Configuration Manager is part of a Task Sequence WMI Condition.  For example: 

**Task Sequence WMI Condition**


    - WMI Namespace – Root\WMI
    - WQL Query – SELECT * FROM MS_SystemInformation WHERE SystemSKU = "Surface_Pro_1796"
